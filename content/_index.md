Stack Overflow is a helpful platform where experienced programmers, developers, experts and others come to share their knowledge to less experienced users. These users are able to ask any questions related to programming and other anyone can answer these questions.
The questions and answers are then stored on the website as valuable data.

This makes the data on Stack Overflow very interesting to analyse social interactions & sub-communities on and there can be obtained insights into different kind of programming patterns.

There will be looked into creating a directed graph network and it's sub-communities with the louvain method. Also looked into explorative analysis with such things as TF-IDF and Confusion matrix.

To see the code used in this project, it can be accessed through the Jupyter Notebook link below:

The dataset used can also be downloaded in the data section of this website.
